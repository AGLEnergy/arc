This tutorial works through a real-world example using the [New York City Taxi dataset](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml) which has been used heavliy around the web (see: [Analyzing 1.1 Billion NYC Taxi and Uber Trips, with a Vengeance](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/) and [A Billion Taxi Rides in Redshift](http://tech.marksblogg.com/billion-nyc-taxi-rides-redshift.html)) due to its 1 billion+ record count and scripted process available on [github](https://github.com/toddwschneider/nyc-taxi-data).

It is a great dataset as it has a lot of the attributes of real-world data we want to demonstrate:

- [Schema Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_evolution) where fields are added/changed/removed over time or data is normalized as patterns emerge.
- How to reliably apply data typing to an untyped source - in this case [Comma-Separated Values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format.
- How to build a repeatable and reproducible process which will scale by adding more compute - the small example is ~40 million records and the large 1+ billion records.
- How reusable components can be composed to [extract data](/extract/#delimitedextract) with [data types](/transform/#typingtransform), apply rules to ensure [data quality](/validate/#sqlvalidate), enrich the data by executing [SQL statements](/transform/#sqltransform), apply [machine learning transformations](/transform/#mltransform) and [load the data](/load) to one or more destinations.

## Get the Data

In the repository there is a directory called `tutorial`. There are two scripts in that directory `download_raw_data_large.sh` and `download_raw_data_small.sh`. The small version will download data for approximately 40 million records (6.3GB) and the large will download more than one billion rows of data. Either of these files can be used for this tutorial. 

Run the tutorial by calling the Docker container from the directory in which you want to place the data:

```bash
export ETL_CONF_BASE_URL=/tutorial
docker run \
-v "$(pwd):${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}" \
-e "ETL_CONF_ENV=test" \
-e "ETL_CONF_BASE_URL=${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}" \
-it -p 4040:4040 seddonm1/arc:1.2.1 \
/bin/sh -c '/opt/tutorial/nyctaxi/download_raw_data_small.sh'
```

After that comand runs there should be a directory structure like this in your current directory:

```bash
find
.
./data
./data/central_park_weather
./data/central_park_weather/0
./data/central_park_weather/0/central_park_weather.csv
./data/yellow_tripdata
./data/yellow_tripdata/3
./data/yellow_tripdata/3/yellow_tripdata_2017-01.csv
./data/yellow_tripdata/1
./data/yellow_tripdata/1/yellow_tripdata_2015-01.csv
./data/yellow_tripdata/2
./data/yellow_tripdata/2/yellow_tripdata_2016-07.csv
./data/yellow_tripdata/0
./data/yellow_tripdata/0/yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv
./data/green_tripdata
./data/green_tripdata/1
./data/green_tripdata/1/green_tripdata_2015-01.csv
./data/green_tripdata/2
./data/green_tripdata/2/green_tripdata_2016-07.csv
./data/green_tripdata/0
./data/green_tripdata/0/green_tripdata_2013-09.csv
./data/green_tripdata/0/green_tripdata_2013-08.csv
./data/uber_tripdata
./data/uber_tripdata/1
./data/uber_tripdata/0
./data/uber_tripdata/0/uber-raw-data-apr14.csv
```

At this stage you can run a job. The `--driver-memory=12G` option should be set with as much memory as you can give it. Also note the `+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap` which is included so that the JVM can detect how much memory is available when running inside a Docker container.

```bash
docker run \
-v "$(pwd):${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}" \
-e "ETL_CONF_ENV=test" \
-e "ETL_CONF_BASE_URL=${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}" \
-it -p 4040:4040 seddonm1/arc:1.2.1 \
bin/spark-submit \
--master local[*] \
--driver-memory=12G \
--driver-java-options="-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap" \
--class au.com.agl.arc.ARC \
/opt/spark/jars/arc.jar \
--etl.config.uri=file:///opt/tutorial/nyctaxi/job/0/nyctaxi.json
```

Once that runs successfully it is time to build the job from scratch.

## Structuring Input Data

One of the key things to notice here is that the download script will create multiple directories for each distinct dataset/table. This is deliberate as each directory will correspond to one version of the schema for that dataset to support [Schema Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_evolution). The directory structure seen above was built based on the rules in [this file](https://github.com/toddwschneider/nyc-taxi-data/blob/master/import_trip_data.sh) in the original repository. So for example:

- `./data/green_tripdata/` is the base directory for all data relating to the `green_tripdata` table.
- `./data/green_tripdata/0/` is the source directory for all data which meets the first version of the schema. The download script deliberately adds multiple files to this directory to show how the framework can read multiple files per data version.
- `./data/green_tripdata/1/` is the source directory for all data which meets the second version of the schema which was first seen in the file `green_tripdata_2015-01.csv`. The assumption here is that any file received prior to `2015-01` should have the same schema as the rest of the files in `./data/green_tripdata/0/` and so be downloaded to `./data/green_tripdata/0/`.
- `./data/green_tripdata/2/` is the source directory for all data which meets the third version of the schema which was first seen in the file `green_tripdata_2016-07.csv`.

At this stage we have not specified what or how to apply a schema we have just physically partitioned the data in to directories that can then be used to find all the files relating to a specific version of a schema.

## Building a Job

We are going to build a full end-to-end job in this tutorial. So start by creating a `job` directory under the `./tutorial/nyctaxi/` root directory. Then create a `0` directory and in that directory create a `nyctaxi.json` file. This file will be the job that tells the framework how to execute. Just like the data we are also specifying a version.

``` bash
mkdir -p job/0/
touch job/0/nyctaxi.json
find job
job
job/0
job/0/nyctaxi.json
```

The job file is basically a big `json` type file which describes an `array` of `stages`. Each `stage` is a single-purpose execution which will do one operation only. Edit the job file to set up the stages scaffold so we are ready to build the actual business logic:

```json
{
  "stages": [
  ]
}
```

{{< note title="JSON vs HOCON" >}}
The config file, whilst looking very similar to a `json` file is actually a [Human-Optimized Config Object Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOCON) (HOCON) file. This file format is a superset of `json` allowing some very useful extensions like [Environment Variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) substitution and string interpolation. We primarily use it for Environment Variable injection but all its capabilities described [here](https://github.com/lightbend/config) can be utilised.
{{</note>}}

## Extracting Data

The first stage we are going to add is a `DelimitedExtract` stage because the source data is in Comma-Seperated Values (delimited by '`,`') format. This stage will instruct Spark to read all `.csv` files from the `inputURI` path. This will be created as a Spark internal view as `green_tripdata0_raw` so it can be referred to in subsequent job stages.

The use of the environment variable substitution `${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}` means that we can change the easily change root path of the files depending on environment. So, for example, it could be use to switch data paths for local (`ETL_CONF_BASE_URL=/tmp/data/`) vs remote `ETL_CONF_BASE_URL=hdfs://datalake/` when moving from test to production.

```json
{
  "stages": [
    {
      "type": "DelimitedExtract",
      "name": "extract data from green_tripdata/0",
      "environments": ["production", "test"],
      "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/data/green_tripdata/0/*.csv",
      "outputView": "green_tripdata0_raw",            
      "persist": false,
      "delimiter": "Comma",
      "quote" : "DoubleQuote",
      "header": true,
      "authentication": {
      },
      "params": {
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Typing Data

At this stage we have a stage which will tell Spark where to read one or more files and produce a table that looks like this and has all string typed fields.

|VendorID|lpep_pickup_datetime|Lpep_dropoff_datetime|Store_and_fwd_flag|RateCodeID|Pickup_longitude|Pickup_latitude|Dropoff_longitude|Dropoff_latitude|Passenger_count|Trip_distance|Fare_amount|Extra|MTA_tax|Tip_amount|Tolls_amount|Ehail_fee|Total_amount|Payment_type|Trip_type|
|--------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------|----------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|-----|-------|----------|------------|---------|------------|------------|---------|
|2|2013-09-01 00:02:00|2013-09-01 00:54:51|N|1|-73.952407836914062|40.810726165771484|-73.983940124511719|40.676284790039063|5|14.35|50.5|0.5|0.5|10.3|0|null|61.8|1|null|
|2|2013-09-01 00:02:34|2013-09-01 00:20:59|N|1|-73.963020324707031|40.711833953857422|-73.966644287109375|40.681690216064453|1|3.24|15|0.5|0.5|0|0|null|16|2|null|

To make this data more useful for querying (for example doing aggregation by time period) we need to apply data typing. 

Add a new stage to apply a `TypingTransformation` to the data extracted in the first stage named `green_tripdata0_raw` and which will parse the data and produce an output dataset called `green_tripdata0` with correctly typed data. To do this we have to tell Spark how to parse the text data back into their original data types. To do this transformation we need some way to pass in the description of how to parse the data and that is descriped in the `metadata` file passed in using the `inputURI` key and described in the next step.

```json
{
  "stages": [
    {
      "type": "DelimitedExtract",
      "name": "extract data from green_tripdata/0",
      "environments": ["production", "test"],
      "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/data/green_tripdata/0/*.csv",
      "outputView": "green_tripdata0_raw",            
      "persist": false,
      "delimiter": "Comma",
      "quote" : "DoubleQuote",
      "header": true,
      "authentication": {
      },
      "params": {
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "TypingTransform",
      "name": "apply green_tripdata/0 data types",
      "environments": ["production", "test"],
      "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/meta/green_tripdata/0/green_tripdata.json",
      "inputView": "green_tripdata0_raw",            
      "outputView": "green_tripdata0",            
      "persist": false,
      "authentication": {
      },       
      "params": {
      }
    }   
  ]
}
```

## Specifying Data Typing Rules

The [metadata format](/metadata/) provides the information needed to parse an untyped dataset into a typed dataset. Where a traditional database will fail when a data conversion fails Spark defaults to returning nulls which makes safely and precisely parsing data using only Spark very difficult. 

{{< note title="Metadata Order" >}}
This format does not use input field names and will only try to convert data by its column index - meaning that the order of the fields in the meatadata file must match the input dataset.

Here is the full text which should already exist in `tutorial/nyctaxi/meta/green_tripdata/0/green_tripdata.json` but you should create a copy of it to `meta/green_tripdata/0/green_tripdata.json`. The description fields have come from the [official data dictionary](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml).

Picking one of the more interesting fields, a [timestamp](/metadata/#timestamp) field, we can highlight a few details:

- the `id` value is a unique identifier for this field (in this case a `string` formatted `uuid`). This field can be used to help track changes in the business *intent* of the field, for example if the field changed name from `lpep_pickup_datetime` to just `pickup_datetime` in a subsequent schema it is still the same field as the *intent* has not changed, just the name so the same `id` value should be retained.
- the `formatters` key specifies an `array` rather than a simple `string`. This is because in real world data it is quite possible to see multiple date/datetime formats used in a single column. By defining an `array` Spark will try to apply each of the formats specified in sequence and only fail if none of the formatters can be successfully applied.
- a mandatory `timezoneId` must be specified. This is because if you work with datetime enough you will find that the only way to reliably work with dates and times across systems is to convert them all to [Coordinated Universal Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) (UTC) so they can be placed as instantaneous point on a universally continuous time-line.
- the `nullableValues` key also specifies an `array` which allows you to specify multiple values which will be converted to a true `null` when loading. If these values are present and the `nullable` key is set to `true` then the job will fail with a clear error message.
- the description field is saved with the data some formats like when using [ORCLoad](/load/#orcload) or [ParquetLoad](/load/#parquetload) into the underlying metadata and will be restored automatically if those files are re-injested by Spark.

```json
  {

So what happens if this conversion fails?

## Data Load Validation

The `TypingTransformation` silently adds an addition field to each row called `_errors` which holds an `array` of data conversion failures - if any exist - so that each row can be parsed and multiple issues collected. If a data conversion issue exists then the field `name` and a human readable message will be pushed into that array and the value will be set to `null` for that field. If you have specified that the field cannot be `null` via `"nullable": false` then the job will fail at this point with an appropriate error message.

If the job has been configured like above with all fields `"nullable": true` then the `TypingTransform` stage will complete but we will not be verifying if any errors occured. To add the ability to stop the job based on whether errors occured we can add a `SQLValidate` stage:

```json
{
  "stages": [
    {
      "type": "DelimitedExtract",
      "name": "extract data from green_tripdata/0",
      "environments": ["production", "test"],
      "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/data/green_tripdata/0/*.csv",
      "outputView": "green_tripdata0_raw",            
      "persist": false,
      "delimiter": "Comma",
      "quote" : "DoubleQuote",
      "header": true,
      "authentication": {
      },
      "params": {
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "TypingTransform",
      "name": "apply green_tripdata/0 data types",
      "environments": ["production", "test"],
      "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/meta/green_tripdata/0/green_tripdata.json",
      "inputView": "green_tripdata0_raw",            
      "outputView": "green_tripdata0",            
      "persist": true,
      "authentication": {
      },       
      "params": {
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "SQLValidate",
      "name": "ensure no errors exist after data typing",
      "environments": ["production", "test"],
      "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/job/0/sqlvalidate_errors.sql",            
      "sqlParams": {
          "table_name": "green_tripdata0"
      },              
      "authentication": {
      },    
      "params": {
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

For this to work we need to create a file called `job/0/sqlvalidate_errors.sql` which contains:

```sql
SELECT
  SUM(error) = 0
  ,TO_JSON(NAMED_STRUCT('count', COUNT(error), 'errors', SUM(error)))
FROM (
  SELECT 
    CASE 
      WHEN SIZE(_errors) > 0 THEN 1 
      ELSE 0 
    END AS error 
  FROM ${table_name}
) input_table
```

The summary of what happens in this SQL statement is:

- sum up the number of rows where the `SIZE` of the `_errors` array for each row is greater than 0.  If the array is not empty then there must have been at least one error on that row (`SIZE(_errors) > 0`)
- check that that sum of errors `SUM(error) = 0` as a predicate so that the first field will return `true` if `SUM(error) = 0` or `false` if `SUM(error) != 0`
- as doing a count is visiting all rows anyway we can emit statistics so the output will be a `json` object that will be added to the logs. In this case we are logging a row count (`COUNT(error)`) and a count of rows with at least 1 error (`SUM(error)`) which will return something like `{"count":57270,"errors":0}`.

One interesting behaviour is that before the SQL statement is executed the framework will allow you to do parameter replacement. So in the definition for the `SQLValidate` stage there is an key called `sqlParams` which allows you to specify named parameters:

```json
"sqlParams": {
    "table_name": "green_tripdata0"
}
```

In this case before the SQL statement is executed the named parameter `${table_name}` will be replaced with `green_tripdata0` so it will validate the specified dataset. The benefit of this is that the same SQL statement can be used for any dataset after the `TypingTransformation` stage to ensure there are no data typing errors and all we have to do is specify a different `table_name` substitution value.

{{< note title="Data Persistence" >}}
A `TypingTransformation` is a big and computationally expensive operation so if you are going to do multiple operations against that dataset (as we are) set the `"persist": true` option so that Spark will cache the dataset after applying the types.
{{</note>}}

## Execute It

At this stage we have a job which will apply data types to one or more `.csv` files and execute a `SQLValidate` stage to ensure that the data could be converted successfully. The Spark ETL framework is packaged with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) so that you can run the same job on your local machine or a massive compute cluster without having to think about how to package dependencies. The Docker image contains the dependencies files for connecting to most `JDBC`, `XML`, `Avro` and cloud services.

To run first set an environment variable which is going to tell Spark where to read all the data from. If you are running this locally export a variable. You may need to modify `run_etl_job_local.sh` to increase the `--driver-memory=` from `12G` as the job gets more complex - or if you are on a machine with not enough available memory disable the `"persist": true` options at the expense of job runtime.

```bash
docker run \
-v "$(pwd):${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}" \
-e "ETL_CONF_ENV=test" \
-e "ETL_CONF_BASE_URL=${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}" \
-it -p 4040:4040 seddonm1/arc:1.2.1 \
bin/spark-submit \
--master local[*] \
--driver-memory=12G \
--driver-java-options="-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap" \
--class au.com.agl.arc.ARC \
/opt/spark/jars/arc.jar \
--etl.config.uri=file://${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}/job/0/nyctaxi.json
```

Going forward to run a different version of the job just change the `/job/0` part to the correct version.

As the job runs you will see `json` formatted logs generated and printed to screen. These can easily be sent to a [log management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_management) solution for log aggregation/analysis/alerts. The important thing is that our job ran and we can see our message `{"count":57270,"errors":0}` formatted as numbers so that it can be easily addressed (`event.message.count`) and summed/compared day by day for monitoring.

```json
{"event":"exit","duration":1724,"stage":{"sqlParams":{"table_name":"green_tripdata0"},"name":"ensure no errors exist after data typing","type":"SQLValidate","message":{"count":57270,"errors":0}},"level":"INFO","thread_name":"main","class":"etl.validate.SQLValidate$","logger_name":"local-1524100083660","timestamp":"2018-04-19 01:08:14.351+0000","environment":"test"}
{"event":"exit","status":"success","duration":10424,"level":"INFO","thread_name":"main","class":"etl.ETL$","logger_name":"local-1524100083660","timestamp":"2018-04-19 01:08:14.351+0000","environment":"test"}
```

A snapshot of what we have done so far should be in the repository under `tutorial/job/0/`.

## Add more data

Before we continue we should clone `tutorial/job/0/` to `tutorial/job/1/` so we can see how jobs might evolve as more logic is added.

```bash
cp -R ./job/0 ./job/1
find ./job/1 -type f -exec sed -i "s/job\/0/job\/1/g" {} \;
```

To continue with the `green_tripdata` dataset example we can now add the other two dataset versions. This will show the general pattern for adding additional data and dealing with Schema Evolution. You can see here that adding more data is just chaining adding additional stages to the `stages` array.

```json

      "authentication": {

      "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/job/1/sqlvalidate_errors.sql",            
      "sqlParams": {
          "table_name": "green_tripdata2"
      },              
      "authentication": {
      },    
      "params": {
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

Now we have three typed and validated datasets in memory. How are they merged?

## Merging Data

The real complexity with schema evolution comes with how to deal with fields which are added and removed. In the case of `green_tripdata` the main change over time is the change from giving specific pickup and dropoff co-ordinates (`pickup_longitude`, `pickup_latitude`, `dropoff_longitude`, `dropoff_latitude`) in the early datasets to only providing more generalised (and much more anonymous) `pickup_location_id` and `dropoff_location_id` geographic regions. The easiest way to deal with this is to use a `SQLTransform` and manually define the rules for each dataset before `UNION` the data together. Create a file called `tutorial/job/1/trips.sql`:

```sql
-- first schema 2013-08 to 2014-12
SELECT 
  vendor_id
  ,lpep_pickup_datetime AS pickup_datetime
  ,lpep_dropoff_datetime AS dropoff_datetime
  ,store_and_fwd_flag
  ,rate_code_id
  ,pickup_longitude
  ,pickup_latitude
  ,dropoff_longitude
  ,dropoff_latitude
  ,passenger_count
  ,trip_distance
  ,fare_amount
  ,extra
  ,mta_tax
  ,tip_amount
  ,tolls_amount
  ,ehail_fee
  ,NULL AS improvement_surcharge
  ,total_amount
  ,payment_type AS payment_type_id
  ,NULL AS trip_type_id
  ,NULL AS pickup_location_id
  ,NULL AS dropoff_location_id
FROM green_tripdata0

UNION

-- second schema 2015-01 to 2016-06
SELECT 
  vendor_id
  ,lpep_pickup_datetime AS pickup_datetime
  ,lpep_dropoff_datetime AS dropoff_datetime
  ,store_and_fwd_flag
  ,rate_code_id
  ,pickup_longitude
  ,pickup_latitude
  ,dropoff_longitude
  ,dropoff_latitude
  ,passenger_count
  ,trip_distance
  ,fare_amount
  ,extra
  ,mta_tax
  ,tip_amount
  ,tolls_amount
  ,ehail_fee
  ,improvement_surcharge
  ,total_amount
  ,payment_type AS payment_type_id
  ,NULL AS trip_type_id
  ,NULL AS pickup_location_id
  ,NULL AS dropoff_location_id
FROM green_tripdata1

UNION

-- third schema 2016-07 +
SELECT 
  vendor_id
  ,lpep_pickup_datetime AS pickup_datetime
  ,lpep_dropoff_datetime AS dropoff_datetime
  ,store_and_fwd_flag
  ,rate_code_id
  ,NULL AS pickup_longitude
  ,NULL AS pickup_latitude
  ,NULL AS dropoff_longitude
  ,NULL AS dropoff_latitude
  ,passenger_count
  ,trip_distance
  ,fare_amount
  ,extra
  ,mta_tax
  ,tip_amount
  ,tolls_amount
  ,ehail_fee
  ,improvement_surcharge
  ,total_amount
  ,payment_type AS payment_type_id
  ,NULL AS trip_type_id
  ,pickup_location_id
  ,dropoff_location_id
FROM green_tripdata2
```

Then we can define a `SQLTransform` stage to execute the query:

```json
{
  "type": "SQLTransform",
  "name": "merge _tripdata to create a full trips",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/job/1/trips.sql",
  "outputView": "trips",            
  "persist": true,
  "authentication": {
  },    
  "sqlParams": {
  },    
  "params": {
  }
}
```

A snapshot of what we have done so far should be in the repository under `tutorial/job/1/`.

## Add the rest of the tables

Before we continue we should clone `tutorial/job/1/` to `tutorial/job/2/` so we can see how jobs might evolve as more logic is added.

```bash
cp -R ./job/1 ./job/2
find ./job/2 -type f -exec sed -i "s/job\/1/job\/2/g" {} \;
```

So go ahead and:

- add the file loading for the `yellow_tripdata` and `uber_tripdata` files. There should be 3 stages for each schema load (`DelimitedExtract`, `TypingTransform`, `SQLValidate`) and a total of 8 schemas so 24 stages plus a single `SQLTransform` as the final stage to merge the data.
- modify the `SQLTransform` to include the new datasets.
- run the new version of the job. You will need to increase the ram from 12G to run this stage.

A snapshot of what we have done so far should be in the repository under `tutorial/job/2/`.

## Dealing with Empty Datasets

So if you executed the same job as the one that is `tutorial/job/2/` the previous job should have failed with `"messages":["DelimitedExtract has produced 0 columns and no schema has been provided to create an empty dataframe."]` as the second Uber directory (`data/uber_tripdata/1`) is empty (that was deliberately created to demonstrate this functionality). This is the other part of Schema Evolution we are trying to address: a pre-emptive schema. 

Sometimes you want to deploy a change to production before the files arrive and either the job fails or does not include that new data once it starts arriving. The Spark ETL framework supports this by allowing you to specify a schema for an empty dataset so that if no data arrives in a target `*Extract` directory a dataset with the correct columns and column types is emited so that all subsequent stages that depend on that dataset execute without failure.

```bash
cp -R ./job/2 ./job/3
find ./job/3 -type f -exec sed -i "s/job\/2/job\/3/g" {} \;
```

To fix this issue add a `schemaURI` key which points to the same metadata file used by the `TypingTransform` stage:

```json
{
  "type": "DelimitedExtract",
  "name": "extract data from uber_tripdata/1",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/data/uber_tripdata/1/*.csv",
  "schemaURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/meta/uber_tripdata/1/uber_tripdata.json",
  "outputView": "uber_tripdata1_raw",            
  "persist": false,
  "delimiter": "Comma",
  "quote" : "DoubleQuote",
  "header": true,
  "authentication": {
  },
  "params": {
  }
}
``` 

Also because we are testing that file for data quality using `SQLValidate` we need to change the SQL statement to be able to deal with empty datasets by adding a `COALESCE` to the first return value:

```sql
SELECT
  COALESCE(SUM(error) = 0, TRUE)
  ,TO_JSON(NAMED_STRUCT('count', COUNT(error), 'errors', SUM(error)))
FROM (
  SELECT 
    CASE 
      WHEN SIZE(_errors) > 0 THEN 1 
      ELSE 0 
    END AS error 
  FROM ${table_name}
) input_table
```

Run this job and once it completes you should see in the logs: `"records":40540347`.

## Reference Data

As the business problem is better understood it is common to see [normalization of data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization). For example, in the `yellow_tripdata0` in the early datasets `payment_type` was a `string` field which led to values which were variations on the same intent like `cash` and `CASH`. In the later datasets the `payment_type` has been normailized into a dataset which maps the `'cash'` type to the value `2`. To normalise this data we first need to load a lookup table which is going to define the rules on how to map `payment_type` to `payment_type_id`. 

Once again bump the version:

```bash
cp -R ./job/3 ./job/4
find ./job/4 -type f -exec sed -i "s/job\/3/job\/4/g" {} \;
```

So add these tables to be extracted from the included `data/reference` directory. They are small but we will be using them potentially a lot of times so set `"persist": true`.

```json
{
  "type": "JSONExtract",
  "name": "load payment_type_id reference table",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "inputURI": "/opt/tutorial/nyctaxi/data/reference/payment_type_id.json",
  "outputView": "payment_type_id",            
  "persist": true,
  "multiLine": false,
  "params": {
  }
},
{
  "type": "JSONExtract",
  "name": "load cab_type_id reference table",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "inputURI": "/opt/tutorial/nyctaxi/data/reference/cab_type_id.json",
  "outputView": "cab_type_id",            
  "persist": true,
  "multiLine": false,
  "params": {
  }
},
{
  "type": "JSONExtract",
  "name": "load vendor_id reference table",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "inputURI": "/opt/tutorial/nyctaxi/data/reference/vendor_id.json",
  "outputView": "vendor_id",            
  "persist": true,
  "multiLine": false,
  "params": {
  }
},   
```


{{< note title="JSON multiLine" >}}
In early versions of Spark the only option for `json` datasets was to use a `json` format called [jsonlines](http://jsonlines.org/) which requires each `json` object to be on a single line and multiple `json` objects could appear by having multiple lines of `json` data. This mode can still be enabled by setting `"multiLine": false` but the default in Spark ETL is a single `json` object per file. For reference data, like the data loaded above, we have used a `jsonlines` file to load multiple records in a single json file.
{{</note>}}

The main culprit of non-normalized data is the `yellow_tripdata0` dataset so let's add a `SQLTransform` stage which will do a `LEFT JOIN` to the new reference data then a `SQLValidate` stage to check that all of our refrence table lookups were successful (think foreign key integrity). The use of a `LEFT JOIN` over an `INNER JOIN` is that we don't want to filter out data from `yellow_tripdata0` that doesn't have a lookup value.

```json
{
  "type": "SQLTransform",
  "name": "perform lookups for yellow_tripdata0 reference tables",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/job/4/yellow_tripdata0_enrich.sql",
  "outputView": "yellow_tripdata0_enriched",            
  "persist": true,
  "authentication": {
  },    
  "sqlParams": {
  },    
  "params": {
  }
},
{
  "type": "SQLValidate",
  "name": "ensure that yellow_tripdata0 reference table lookups were successful",
  "environments": ["production", "test"],
  "inputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/job/4/yellow_tripdata0_enrich_validate.sql",            
  "sqlParams": {
  },              
  "authentication": {
  },    
  "params": {
  }
}
```

Where `job/4/yellow_tripdata0_enrich.sql` does the `LEFT JOIN`s:

```sql
SELECT 
  yellow_tripdata0.vendor_name
  ,vendor_id.vendor_id
  ,trip_pickup_datetime AS pickup_datetime
  ,trip_dropoff_datetime AS dropoff_datetime
  ,store_and_fwd_flag
  ,rate_code_id
  ,start_lon AS pickup_longitude
  ,start_lat AS pickup_latitude
  ,end_lon AS dropoff_longitude
  ,end_lat AS dropoff_latitude
  ,passenger_count
  ,trip_distance
  ,fare_amt AS fare_amount
  ,surcharge AS extra
  ,mta_tax
  ,tip_amount
  ,tolls_amount
  ,NULL AS ehail_fee
  ,NULL AS improvement_surcharge
  ,total_amount
  ,LOWER(yellow_tripdata0.payment_type) AS payment_type
  ,payment_type_id.payment_type_id
  ,NULL AS trip_type
  ,NULL AS pickup_nyct2010_gid
  ,NULL AS dropoff_nyct2010_gid
  ,NULL AS pickup_location_id
  ,NULL AS dropoff_location_id
FROM yellow_tripdata0
LEFT JOIN vendor_id ON yellow_tripdata0.vendor_name = vendor_id.vendor
LEFT JOIN payment_type_id ON LOWER(yellow_tripdata0.payment_type) = payment_type_id.payment_type
```

... and then `SQLValidate` verifies that there are no missing values. This query will also collect up the distinct list of missing values so they can be logged and added manually added to the lookup table if required.

```sql
SELECT
  SUM(null_vendor_id) = 0 AND SUM(null_payment_type_id) = 0
  ,TO_JSON(
    NAMED_STRUCT(
      'null_vendor_id'
      ,SUM(null_vendor_id)
      ,'null_vendor_name'
      ,COLLECT_LIST(DISTINCT null_vendor_name)
      ,'null_payment_type_id'
      ,SUM(null_payment_type_id)
      ,'null_payment_type'
      ,COLLECT_LIST(DISTINCT null_payment_type)
    )
  )
FROM (
  SELECT 
    CASE WHEN vendor_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS null_vendor_id
    ,CASE WHEN vendor_id IS NULL THEN vendor_name ELSE NULL END AS null_vendor_name
    ,CASE WHEN payment_type_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS null_payment_type_id
    ,CASE WHEN payment_type_id IS NULL THEN payment_type ELSE NULL END AS null_payment_type
  FROM yellow_tripdata0_enriched
) valid
```

Which will succeed with `"message":{"null_payment_type":[],"null_payment_type_id":0,"null_vendor_id":0,"null_vendor_name":[]}`. 

So now we have a job which will merge all the `*tripdata` datasets into a single master `trips` dataset.

## Saving Data

The final step is to do something with the merged data. This could be any of the [Load](/load/) stages but for our use case we will do a [ParquetLoad](/load/#parquetload). [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) is a great because:

- it is a columnar data format which means that when it is read by subsequent Spark jobs you can only read the columns that are required vastly reducing the amount of data moved across a network and that has to be processed.
- it retains full data types and metadata so that you don't have to keep converting text to corretly typed data
- it supports data partitioning and pushdown which also reduces the amount of data required to be processed

Here is the stage we will add which writes the trips dataset to a `parquet` file on disk. It will also be partitioned by `vendor_id` so that if you were doing analysis on only one of the vendors then Spark could easily read only that data and ignore the other vendors.

```json
{
    "type": "ParquetLoad",
    "name": "write trips back to filesystem",
    "environments": ["production", "test"],
    "inputView": "trips",
    "outputURI": ${ETL_CONF_BASE_URL}"/data/output/trips.parquet",
    "numPartitions": 100,
    "partitionBy": [
        "vendor_id"
    ],
    "authentication": {
    },    
    "params": {}
}
```
